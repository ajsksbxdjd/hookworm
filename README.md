# FEC Analyser — Fecal Egg Count Tool

A full-stack web application for automated hookworm egg detection and counting in microscopy images. Upload fecal flotation slide images, run YOLOv8 inference, and review results through an interactive annotation dashboard.

---

## What it does

- **Automated detection** — runs YOLOv8s on batches of microscopy images to locate and count hookworm eggs
- **Adjustable confidence threshold** — boxes below the threshold are flagged "needs review" and float to the top of the image list; changing the threshold re-buckets everything instantly without re-running inference
- **Per-box review workflow** — confirm or remove individual low-confidence detections; add manual annotations by drawing boxes directly on the image
- **Live dashboard** — EPG (eggs per gram × 24), infection severity (WHO hookworm scale: Light / Moderate / Heavy), average YOLO confidence, and a per-image review checklist that updates in real time
- **CSV export** — per-image egg counts, total eggs, EPG, and confidence threshold in one download
- **Inline batch renaming** — click any batch name to rename it in place

## First-time setup

Do this **once** after cloning. You will not need to repeat these steps every time you run the app.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have these installed before starting:

- **Python 3.10 or newer** — https://www.python.org/downloads/
- **Node.js 18 or newer** — https://nodejs.org/
- **Git** — https://git-scm.com/

---

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ajsksbxdjd/hookworm.git
cd hookworm
```

---

### 2. Backend — create the virtual environment

A virtual environment keeps the Python packages for this project separate from everything else on your machine. You only create it once.

```bash
cd backend
```

**Create the venv:**

```bash
# Windows
python -m venv venv

# Mac / Linux
python3 -m venv venv
```

**Activate it:**

```bash
# Windows — Command Prompt
venv\Scripts\activate

# Windows — PowerShell
venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Mac / Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

You'll know it worked when `(venv)` appears at the start of your terminal prompt.

**Install all Python packages:**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> This installs FastAPI, Uvicorn, SQLAlchemy, Ultralytics YOLOv8, pandas, Pillow, and everything else the backend needs. Takes a few minutes the first time — you will not need to run this again unless `requirements.txt` changes.

---

### 3. Place the trained model file

The YOLOv8 model weights are not stored in the repository (they are too large). You need to put the file in the right place manually.

Create the folder:

```bash
# Windows
mkdir storage\models

# Mac / Linux
mkdir -p storage/models
```

Then copy your trained `best.pt` into it:

```
backend/storage/models/best.pt
```

> Without this file the backend will start but inference jobs will fail with a "model not found" error.

---

### 4. Frontend — install JavaScript packages

Open a **second terminal** (or navigate back to the project root):

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

> This installs Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS, lucide-react, and all other dependencies into a `node_modules` folder. Takes a couple of minutes once. After this you do **not** need to run `npm install` again unless `package.json` changes (e.g. after a `git pull` that adds new packages).

---

## Running the app (every time)

You need **two terminals** running simultaneously — one for the backend API, one for the frontend dev server.

### Terminal 1 — Backend

```bash
cd backend

# Activate the virtual environment (required every new terminal session):
# Windows:   venv\Scripts\activate
# Mac/Linux: source venv/bin/activate

uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --reload
```

The API will be running at **http://localhost:8000**

> `--reload` auto-restarts when you change a Python file — useful during development.  
> `--host 0.0.0.0` lets other devices on the same Wi-Fi reach the app (handy for demos).

---

### Terminal 2 — Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at **http://localhost:3000**

---

Open **http://localhost:3000** in your browser. Both terminals must stay running while you use the app.

---

## Quick-start checklist

```
FIRST TIME ONLY (do once after cloning):
  [ ] cd backend
  [ ] python -m venv venv
  [ ] Activate venv  (venv\Scripts\activate  or  source venv/bin/activate)
  [ ] pip install -r requirements.txt
  [ ] mkdir storage/models  →  copy best.pt into it
  [ ] cd ../frontend
  [ ] npm install

EVERY TIME YOU WANT TO USE THE APP:
  [ ] Terminal 1: cd backend → activate venv → uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --reload
  [ ] Terminal 2: cd frontend → npm run dev
  [ ] Open http://localhost:3000
```

---

## How to use

1. **Create a batch** — on the workspace, enter a sample label, drop in JPG / PNG images or a ZIP archive, and click **Start analysis**
2. **Wait for inference** — a live progress bar shows how many images have been processed; the dashboard opens automatically when done
3. **Review detections**
   - **Green boxes** = accepted (confidence ≥ threshold, or manually confirmed)
   - **Amber boxes** = needs review (confidence below threshold, unconfirmed)
   - **Blue boxes** = manually drawn
   - Images with amber boxes appear at the top of the sidebar
   - Click an amber box → **Confirm egg** (counts it) or **Remove** (discards it)
4. **Add a box** — toggle **Add box** mode, then drag a rectangle over an egg the model missed; it is counted immediately at 100% confidence
5. **Adjust threshold** — use the threshold input (top toolbar) to tighten or loosen acceptance. The EPG and review list update instantly — no re-inference needed
6. **Mark reviewed** — once you are satisfied with an image, click **Mark reviewed** to move it to the Reviewed section in the sidebar
7. **Export** — click **↓ CSV** to download a spreadsheet with per-image counts, total eggs, EPG, and the confidence threshold used

## GPU vs CPU inference

The backend auto-detects CUDA. If you have a compatible NVIDIA GPU with the CUDA toolkit installed, inference runs on the GPU (much faster). Otherwise it falls back to CPU — no config changes needed.

Watch the backend terminal when you submit a batch; it will log `device=cuda` or `device=cpu`.

To tune performance, edit `backend/ml/detector.py`:
- `BATCH_SIZE` — images per forward pass (default 16, lower this on low-VRAM machines)
- `IMG_SIZE` — inference resolution (default 640)

## Common issues

| Problem | Fix |
|---|---|
| `ModuleNotFoundError` when starting backend | Virtual environment not activated — run `venv\Scripts\activate` (Windows) or `source venv/bin/activate` (Mac/Linux) before `uvicorn` |
| Inference fails with "model not found" | Place `best.pt` in `backend/storage/models/best.pt` |
| Frontend shows network errors | Make sure the backend is running on port 8000 before opening the browser |
| `npm run dev` fails immediately | Run `npm install` inside the `frontend/` folder first |
| Images don't appear after upload | `backend/storage/uploads/` is created automatically on first upload — check the backend terminal for any file-permission errors |
| PowerShell blocks venv activation | Run `Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser RemoteSigned` once, then retry |
